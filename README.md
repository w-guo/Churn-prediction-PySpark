# Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook `Sparkify_mini.ipynb` that documents an end-to-end model development process performed on a simulated streaming service dataset using Python API for Spark, `PySpark`.

### Project overview

Predicting customer churn is a challenging and common problem for any e-commerce business in which everything depends on the behavior of customers. Customer churn is often defined as the process in which the customers downgrade from premium to free tier or stop using the products or services of a business. Thus, the ability to predict which users are at risk of churning, while there is still time to offer them discounts or other incentives, will greatly help to prevent every custormer-facing business from suffering severe financial losses.

### Problem statement

The data set in this project is provided by Sparkify, a fictitious digital music service created by Udacity, to resemble the data sets generated by companies such as Spotify or Pandora. The full dataset collects approximately 26 million records from 22277 users, whereas a smaller subset contains 286500 records from 225 users between October 1, 2018 and December 3, 2018. Our goal is to help Spakify identify potential churn users by building and training a binary classifier in order to save the business millions in revenue.

### Prerequisites

In addition to `PySpark`, the following Python libraries are also required to be installed:

* `Pandas`
* `Matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `time`

### Results

The results are best summarized in the  accompanying [blog post](https://wguo.rbind.io/project/sparkify-churn-prediction/).
